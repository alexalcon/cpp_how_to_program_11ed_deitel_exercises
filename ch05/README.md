# Interactive Towers of Hanoi Visualization (Exercise 5.26)

Chapter 5 introduces recursion as a fundamental problem-solving technique. This directory (`./ch05`) includes a `towers_of_hanoi_recursion_visualization.html` file that demonstrates how the recursive algorithm for **Exercise 5.26 — Towers of Hanoi** works step-by-step.This visualization is designed to help you see the **recursive call structure**, **moves generated**, and some **statistics** produced by this classical recursive solution.


## Directory Feature: `towers_of_hanoi_recursion_visualization.html`

Inside the `./ch05` directory, you’ll find:

```
ch05/
 ├── exercise_5_26_v1_0_0.cpp
 ├── ...
 └── towers_of_hanoi_recursion_visualization.html
```

### Purpose of the Visualization

The **HTML file** provides:

* A **dynamic animation** of the recursive solution.
* A visual representation of how **recursive subproblems** reduce to moving $n - 1$ disks.
* A better intuitive grasp of why recursion is the natural solution for this problem.


## Opening and Running the Visualization

No external libraries or dependencies are required.

1. Navigate into the `./ch05` directory.
2. Open the file:

```
towers_of_hanoi_recursion_visualization.html
```

3. Double-click it, or open it manually in a browser such as:

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Firefox

The visualization will begin immediately and animate the full solution for the default number of disks.


## Compatibility Notes

* The visualization is pure **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**.
* No frameworks, build tools, or internet connection required.
* Works on all modern browsers.
* Safe to run locally — everything is self-contained.


## Summary

This chapter’s directory includes a small but powerful addition: an **interactive visualization** of the Towers of Hanoi algorithm for Exercise 5 26.

It is intended to:

* Strengthen conceptual understanding.
* Support recursive reasoning.
* Enhance the educational value of the repository project.
* Demonstrate attention to detail and teaching-oriented documentation.
